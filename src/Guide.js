        <h3>ABOUT TIP</h3>
          
            <li>A tip or gratuity is an extra sum of money paid to certain service workers for a provided service. </li><br />
            <li>Tip amounts, as well as acceptance, vary in different parts of the world. </li><br />

            <li>In some countries in East Asia such as Japan, tips are seen as insulting and can sometimes be interpreted as a bribe.</li><br />
            <li>In yet other countries such as the United States, tipping is widely expected, and in many cases,
         is even factored into a service worker's compensation towards satisfying the minimum wage requirement. </li><br />
            <li>Many servers depend on tips to make a living in countries like the United States.</li><br />
            <li>As such, as a tourist, it can be helpful to research the tipping customs in the countries being visited. </li> <br />
            <li>In the U.S. or any other country where tipping is expected, depending on the restaurant or the number of patrons at a table,
        gratuity may be automatically applied to the bill amount.</li><br />
